## Description

This project focuses on the identification, expression analysis, and functional inference of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in multiple species of the *Leishmania* genus, using a combination of comparative genomics and transcriptomic profiling across key developmental stages.

The repository includes:
- Scripts for ncRNA prediction, filtering, and classification  
- Pipelines for RNA-seq processing and expression quantification  
- Co-expression for functional inference  
- BED files with predicted ncRNA coordinates per species  
- Supplementary materials supporting the manuscript
